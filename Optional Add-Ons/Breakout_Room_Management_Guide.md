# 🔧 Breakout Room Management Guide

This guide is designed for Virtual Course Producers to manage breakout rooms effectively during live online training sessions. It includes pre-session planning, in-session execution, participant support, and post-room best practices.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Breakout rooms create small-group engagement opportunities within a virtual course. Effective breakout room management ensures all participants are assigned correctly, instructions are clear, and facilitators can debrief successfully.

---

## 🗂️ Pre-Session Planning

### ✅ Key Questions to Confirm with Instructor

- How many breakout rooms are needed?
- Will assignments be random or pre-defined?
- How long should the breakout activity last?
- Should a presenter or facilitator stay in the main room?
- Should any presenters **not** be assigned to rooms?
- Will each group have a spokesperson?

### 🔧 Setup Steps (Teams / Zoom / Webex)

1. Open meeting early and verify breakout room feature is enabled.
2. Pre-create rooms (if platform supports).
3. Pre-assign participants (optional, may require email addresses).
4. Draft instructions for the activity to post in chat.
5. Confirm presenter visibility (assign as **co-organizer** in Teams to exclude them from rooms automatically).

---

## 🚦 In-Session Management

### 👨‍💻 Launching Rooms

- Confirm breakout rooms are ready before the activity begins.
- Announce the room structure in the main chat:
  ```text
  Rooms are now opening. You’ll be auto-assigned in just a moment.
  Reminder: Discuss the quote on page 24 and answer the first five questions. Select a spokesperson!
  ```

- Click **Open Rooms** (Teams) or **Start** (Zoom/Webex).

---

### 🚫 Prevent Common Errors

- **External Presenters:** Must be manually unassigned (not eligible for co-organizer status).
- **Presenter Assigned to Room?**
  - In Teams: During assignment, locate their name and change from Room # to “Unassigned.”
  - In Zoom/Webex: Deselect them or drag them out of the room list.

- Always verify instructors and facilitators remain in the main room.

---

## 💬 During the Activity

### 📣 Announcements to Use

```text
T-minus 5 minutes — please wrap up your group’s discussion and prepare your spokesperson.
```

```text
T-minus 2 minutes — we’ll be closing the breakout rooms soon.
```

```text
T-minus 1 minute — returning to the main room shortly!
```

```text
Copy that — rooms closing soon. See you back in the main room!
```

### 👁️ Monitoring Tips

- Float between rooms if the platform allows it.
- Keep the main room open in case someone is disconnected or joins late.
- Stay in touch with instructors to extend or shorten breakout time if needed.

---

## 📥 Post-Room Support

### 🧾 Room Closure & Debrief

- Click **Close Rooms** or wait for countdown to end.
- Reconfirm everyone has returned to the main room.
- Prompt group spokespersons:
  ```text
  Welcome back! Let’s hear from each group — who’s speaking for Room 1?
  ```

### ✅ After Action Tasks

- Confirm all questions from the chat during breakout are addressed.
- Share any group notes or documents if collected.
- Log any technical issues for future sessions.

---

## 📌 Tips & Best Practices

- Keep breakout activities short and focused (10–20 minutes).
- Post written instructions in the chat **before** opening rooms.
- Always have a backup communication plan (e.g., private chat or main room messaging).
- Monitor time actively and prepare announcements in advance.

---

## 🧷 Optional Enhancements

- Use shared Google Docs or Microsoft Whiteboards for collaborative breakout tasks.
- Assign a notetaker and spokesperson role to increase accountability.
- Record debriefs for post-session review or insights.
