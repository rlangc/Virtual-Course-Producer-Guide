## Core Responsibilities

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Session Prep** | Coordinate with facilitators, load polls, prepare materials, and adjust meeting options. |
| **Real-Time Support** | Manage chat, tech issues, announcements, polls, and breakout rooms during the session. |
| **Session Transitions** | Post time cues, guide activity flow, and manage breaks or group debriefs. |

| **Post-Session Tasks** | Export and clean attendance records, confirm recordings, and wrap communications. |

## Producer’s Tipsheet

### Pre-Meeting

- **Meeting Link Configuration**
  - When sending the calendar invite, go to **“Response Options”** and **disable “Request Responses”** to reduce clutter.
  - If adding co-organizers, **individually list them in the invite recipient list**. Distribution lists or routers will not work.

- **Instructor Coordination**
  - Confirm if any **polls**, **breakout rooms**, or **materials** need to be prepared or distributed.
  - If using polls, **pre-create them as drafts** in Teams so you can launch them during the session on cue.
  - Ask presenters if they’d like help monitoring chat — and clarify whether to **pause during natural breaks** or **interrupt with questions** in real time.

### During Meeting

- **Breakout Room Management**
  - **Do not assign presenters to breakout rooms**.
    - **Internal presenters**: Mark as co-organizers (auto-exempt from rooms).
    - **External presenters**: Must be manually unassigned by selecting their name and choosing “Unassigned.”

- **Troubleshooting Guidance**
  - First step: **Leave and rejoin the meeting**.
  - If unresolved: Try another **gov-issued device** or **reboot the current device**.

- **Participant Engagement**
  - Monitor the chat and use scripted prompts.
  - Manage session pacing and timing using “T-minus” announcements.
  - Keep a direct line with the instructor to coordinate transitions.

### Post-Meeting

- **Attendance Sheet Formatting**
  - Download the attendance sheet after the session.
  - Save as **Excel Workbook (.xlsx)** — required for formatting integrity.
  - Ensure key columns are clearly readable under the “Participants” tab:
    - **Name**
    - **First Join**
    - **Last Leave**
    - **In-Meeting Duration**

- **Session Wrap-Up**
  - Confirm whether the recording was successfully saved (if applicable).
  - Email follow-up if needed with materials, recordings, or attendance.

## Sample Prompts for Use During the Session

| Category | Prompt Example |
|---------|----------------|
| **Opening** | “Good morning, everyone! Welcome to Day 3 of [Course Name]. My name is [Name], your producer today. If you have any connectivity issues or tech concerns, please reach out directly in the chat.” |
| **Breaks** | “Please take a 5-minute break and return at [Time].”<br>“Please break for lunch and return at [Time].” |
| **T-Minus Warnings** | “T-minus 5 minutes; Be sure to capture feedback for your exercise!”<br>“T-minus 1 minute; please have your spokesperson ready!” |
| **Breakout Room Checks** | “Checking in — how’s the activity going in your breakout room? Any questions, comments, concerns? Throw them in the chat, please!” |
| **Session Transition** | “Copy that, rooms closing. We’ll begin pulling you back to the main room shortly!” |
